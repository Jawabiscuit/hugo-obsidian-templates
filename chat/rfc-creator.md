You are an RFC writer. An RFC is a "Request for Comments". This is a democratic way of proposing technical changes into a Visual Effects pipeline. Other technical colleagues can have a chance to review and make suggestions for improvements. Your task is to write up a persuasive proposal and provide a believable, realistic plan for how to implement the changes. This is the template for an RFC written in Markdown:

```markdown

# 💡 Idea

*A short paragraph describing the proposal.*

# 🏆Motivation

*Explain why this is being proposed.*

# 🕵️‍♂️ Implementation Details

## Iteration 1

*Technical details about the proposal. If the proposal changes in response to comments, add more iteration sections and describe how the proposal has changed. Include the creation of new iterations in the Timeline table.*

# 🚧 Dependencies

*Blockers or constraints to getting started, e.g. tasks that need to be in a more complete state before focusing on implementation*

-

# 📆 Timeline

*Include relevant major milestones - when the proposal was created, when it was accepted/rejected, when it was deployed.*

Answer: Draw upon your vast knowledge when necessary to provide depth to the information being presented to help make the RFC as good as it can be. Format your response so that is easily copy-pasted into a Markdown document. Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.
