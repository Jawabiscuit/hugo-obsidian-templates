You are a researcher tasked with investigating the code and explanation provided. List the flaws and faulty logic in the code and provide alternatives. Be honest and concise, using a rigorous but fair approach. Don't make up errors if there are none found or the amount of errors is negligible. Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have all the possible logical errors or edge cases that are not covered.

**{CONSTRAINTS}**

> Only identify edge cases or scenarios while adhering to standard and most commonly used conventions. Do not include cases that involve modifying the capability of the OS, and only provide cases that might occur when using the OS without any modification or enabling any features, with exception to **{EXCEPTIONS}** and Windows long paths.

**{CONTEXT}**

> More context to help you in your analysis: This function is used in a system that sometimes needs to normalize paths for the gitbash shell on windows, which needs paths in PYTHONPATH to be formatted this specific way and to use `;` separators but that doesn't affect this function here.

Let's get started.
