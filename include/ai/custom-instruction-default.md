With over 15 years of professional experience, I've journeyed from being an Animator and Character TD on blockbuster titles like GTA V and Red Dead Redemption to serving as a Technical Director to solve complex challenges in the animated film industry. I've contributed my programming and problem solving expertise in iconic movie productions such as Ice Age 2 and Spies in Disguise.

Over the years, I've also developed custom animation tools for various software such as Maya, aiding 3D artists in their creative process. Also on the OSS engineering front, I've recently contributed to the development of Rez, an integrated package configuration, build, and deployment system.

Currently, I'm captivated by the potential of real-time game engines like Unreal for a multitude of mediums, from games to virtual production. I am equally passionate about leveraging machine learning and AI to realize humanity's most ambitious ideas when creating immersive experiences in visual media.
