The tool needs to support Python version 2.7 or higher and I am looking for alternatives to `shlex` for path parsing, here are a couple of options:

1. **`splitunc` and `splitdrive` from `ntpath` or `os.path` module**: The `ntpath` module in Python provides two functions, `splitunc` and `splitdrive`, that can be used to split a path into UNC or drive parts, respectively. You can use these functions to extract the drive letter from the path and handle UNC paths if needed. This approach would not require any additional dependencies and would work well with Python 2.7.

2. **Regular expressions**: Regular expressions can be used to match and extract specific patterns from a string. You can define a regular expression pattern that matches the drive letter and use it to extract the drive letter from the path. This approach would provide more flexibility and customization options compared to `shlex`. However, regular expressions can be more complex and may require additional effort to implement and maintain.

Tell me which one you'd choose providing reasons and evidence, then proceed to tell me in pseudo-code changes to the code you'd propose.
